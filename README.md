This repository provides a stub implementation of the interface defined in the
[Lily server protocol](https://github.com/FascinatedBox/lily-server-protocol).
Since this implementation doesn't rely on an underlying server, it can be used
for mocking a server without having one running.

You can install this with garden using

```
garden.py install github FascinatedBox/lily-fake-server
```
